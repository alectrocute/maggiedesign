description: "Colorshot is better for you and our planet as it is formulated without Xylene, Benzene, Toluene and toxic dryers while the propellant is derived from sugarcane instead of petroleum. Colorshot was featured on HGTV, Flip or Flop Vegas and Extreme Makeover Home Edition. The line started as a Home Depot Exclusive, but can now be found at Home Depot, Walmart, Michaels and more."
