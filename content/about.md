I'm a Tucson, Arizona based designer with 10 years of experience. I specialize in packaging and branding.

Outside of designing, Iâ€™m a hobbyist and maker. I enjoy exercise, roadtrips and scratch cooking!

Alumni of Ringling College of Art + Design since 2014.

Freelance opportunities are always welcome. me@maggie.design
