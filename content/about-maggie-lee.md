<br/><br/>
I’m a Tucson, Arizona–based designer with 13 years of experience specializing in fragrance and beauty packaging and branding.
<br/><br/>
Outside of design, I’m a hands-on maker who enjoys staying active, road trips, and scratch cooking.
<br/><br/>
Ringling College of Art + Design alum (2014).

Freelance opportunities are always welcome.
